# ATM02: Feature, Step Definitions, and Code Skeleton

## Project Overview
This project includes feature files, step definitions, and a basic code skeleton for the ATM operations, but the code itself is not fully implemented. The focus here is to write the structure of the ATM code without functionality.

## Features
- Cucumber feature file for ATM operations
- Step definitions provided
- Skeleton for ATM operations, but no functionality yet

## Prerequisites
- .NET 7 SDK (or higher)
- SpecFlow for Cucumber testing in C#

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
3. Check the `ATMOperations.cs` file, which contains the class structure for ATM operations.
4. Running the tests will pass, as the actual logic is not implemented in main `src`.

## Running Tests
1. Navigate to the test project folder.
2. Use the following command to run tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
